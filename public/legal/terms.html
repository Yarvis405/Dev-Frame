          <h2>Welcome</h2>

          <div>
            <p>First of all welcome to Dev Frame. Well if you have read the introduction in home page, you should know what this is about already.</p>
            <p>Now in case you didn't well <span style="font-size: 2rem">&#x2192;</span> <a href="/">you welcome :]</a> </p>
            <p>Ones again welcome to Dev Frame.</p>

          <h2>Contract</h2>

          <div>
            <p>Well the web page is still worked on, so this could be kind of rogue on you'll.</p>
            <p>The thing is that since there's no <b>Electronic Payment Method</b> the transactions will go differently, to be straight forward the thing is that you the client would have to pay 25% of the total service price, because as a developer its a risk specially if there's possible scammers.</p>
            <p>But is not that at all the client have to also compromise with the developer in case the client starts a project and decide to stop the project the developer gets to keep the 25%, so the time used by the client could have been used completing other projects.</p>
            <p>But event though the rules say as so there is an exception if the project have no more than <b>7 days</b> in development or more than <b>20 days</b> in <b>Planning Stage</b> well the client is guarateed to recover the money, well but what about the rest?</p>
            <p>Well the rest of the money would be more straight forward, not before higlighting that the another 25% percent have to be paid after a beta of the project project have been presented, beta reffers to a liable progress. I is just a way to prevent fraud since client could decide to stop development at mid project</p>
            <p>Last but not least the missing 50% would be given at the end of the project performing final transaction and delivery of the completed project.</p>
            <p><b>NOTE:</b>Well is pretty obvious but there would be constant communication from both ends but in a better solution is to have a conference timeline where we decide to meet(video conference, calls, or in-person if possible). The objective of those meeting we'll not be other than to talk about the project any other interest in starting new projects or else we'll strictly have to wait until the end of the current project.</p>

            <p><b>IN ADDITION: Each Project will have a deadend in case the deadend have passed and the client haven't decided to give the developer an extra time the developer would have to return a 60% of the total price</b></p>

          <h3>After Request</h3>

          <div>
            <p>this is rather vag but well. after you have sent request, you might to wait until you request get proccessed(which is intended to be a maximum of a week but it might as well take longer) the projects can be accepted or rejected which depends on project, complexity, price, and several other factors</p>
            
            <br>

            <h4>About the Accepted Request</h4>

            <p>when a project is accepted the workflow after that is easy, several conferences with the client to decide when to start the project and a dead end for it as well those factors as for the payment depends on the project complexity and client availability as well</p>
            <p><b>Note:</b> In case you wonder the 25% is paid after those meetings since they are meetings about timeline, workflows, dead-end (of which you will be given a syllabus), etc.</p>
